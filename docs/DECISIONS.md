# Decisions

Add new decisions at the bottom of the right list, with the date. Only the owner (Taren) decides. A PROPOSED item stays open until the owner says yes.

## Decided

### 2026-10-27: The Cabinet Vision build spec (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` v0.1)
- The platform does sales, intake and design: room capture, selections, an AI first draft, and a visual editor. Cabinet Vision engineers the job and makes the production files. This replaces the 2026-10-24 plan, where Mozaik was the design tool.
- Our master copy is the single source of truth for every job (P1).
- Cabinet Vision is the first CAD target. We write its ORDX import file, read the engineered job back, and compare.
- The product stays independent of any CAD vendor. Only the Cabinet Vision adapter knows it exists (P2, G4).
- Size ranges, options, mappings and design rules are data (P3).
- Fail closed: anything missing, unmapped, out of range or ambiguous blocks the step (P4, G5).
- AI writes the translators and drafts designs. Translation itself is ordinary, repeatable code (P5).
- The editor draws only from the master copy (P6).
- At least one read-back check uses Cabinet Vision's own engineered output (P7).
- Build order: test translation first. Phases 0 and 1 end in a go/no-go before the editor and AI are built.
- Out of scope for v1: engineering cabinets, CNC output, cutlists, machining, a Mozaik push, and photorealistic rendering.
- Mozaik may come back later as read-back only (Phase 8).

### 2026-10-27: Owner answers and the fuller workflow (BUILD_SPEC "Owner amendments" OA-1 to OA-10)
- **A shop is a manufacturing partner: today one Hutterite colony; possibly more colonies later.** In-house only: "We will not sell this software to other people, it will only be used for our own sales." (Answers S-0.)
- The tool's job is to remove manual drawing. Rough inputs, the visual intake and the design rules produce a well-designed room, with **photorealistic viewing** and **live pricing**. No parametrics, construction or sheet optimization.
- **Photorealistic viewing is in scope.** This reverses the spec's section 2.
- The push to Cabinet Vision happens once, and only when four things are true:
  - the client has signed off the design;
  - the appliances are confirmed;
  - the site is measured;
  - the job is paid.
- The library sync and the job read-back are **automatic loops**.
- In scope:
  - the conversation tally (email, texts, meeting transcripts);
  - automated client reminders with a deadline ticker;
  - automatic ordering of materials, doors, counters, handles and add-ons when a job goes into production.

### 2026-10-27: UCS library kept apart from the platform
- The shop's Cabinet Vision UCS library lives in its own repo, `cabinet-vision-ucs`, not in this one (owner's choice, so platform work can't change it by accident).
- Sessions on this repo attach it **read-only** and never commit, push or open pull requests to it. Changes to UCSs happen only in sessions on that repo.
- The adapter needs UCS knowledge at build time, not runtime: which UCS settings it may send, and what changes UCSs make to the engineered job so the read-back check doesn't flag them as errors.
- **PROPOSED:** mapping entries that name a UCS setting record the UCS repo commit they were checked against, and the golden tests catch a UCS change that breaks a mapping.

### Still in force from the earlier plan (2026-10-24 and before)
- Modular monolith with enforced module boundaries; one owner per table; data, not code.
- Fail loudly: alerts persist until a person resolves them with a note. Never show false success.
- Money in integer cents (CAD).
- A permission framework from day one. Owner, admin and designer roles first; more roles are added as data.
- Full change history and audit log from day one. History is never overwritten.
- Hosting: Netlify + Supabase (Canada region).
- CRM and accounting are swappable connectors (later).
- Quotes freeze the prices and tax used.
- Multi-user locking: one editor at a time, others read-only. Locks release when the session drops; managers can override.

### Replaced on 2026-10-27
- ~~Mozaik is the design source of truth; this tool can't write to Mozaik.~~ The master copy is the source of truth; Cabinet Vision is the target.
- ~~Lengths in integer mm.~~ The base unit is open (U-1).
- ~~Mozaik data captured from the SketchUp export and job files; manual upload, then a Windows desktop uploader; upload matches confirmed by a person.~~ Dropped. A Mozaik reader may come back in Phase 8, from its SQLite export.
- ~~Guided Mozaik drawing.~~ Replaced by the AI draft and the visual editor.
- ~~Build starts with the quick quote, after the foundation.~~ Build starts with Phase 0 discovery and the Phase 1 proof slice.
- ~~(2026-10-24) closet-builder is kept for reference only; no code is carried over.~~ Reopened as C-1, because a visual editor and room capture are back in scope.

## Open questions

### Needed before Phase 1 code
- **CV-1 Where does Cabinet Vision run, and who works in it?** Is it on a computer at the colony, operated by colony staff, or with you? How reliable is that computer's internet? The automatic library sync and read-back (OA-6) need something running on that computer. Phase 0's samples also come from there.
- **U-1 Base unit (spec Q5).** The intake uses feet (7', 8', 10'), so the shop looks imperial. Options:
  - 1/64 inch (the spec's candidate);
  - millimetres (the earlier plan);
  - nanometres (closet-builder). It holds both mm and 1/64 inch exactly (1/64 in = 396,875 nm), but area numbers grow too large.

  Recommendation: decide once Phase 0 shows which units and precision ORDX uses.
- **CV-2 Can the import file set our UCS settings?** For example, can it switch on a sidebar choice like "Floating Vanity?" for one cabinet? If not, those choices must be made in Cabinet Vision after import. Answer from the Phase 0 samples, not by guessing.
- **A-1 Angle convention.** Proposed for Phase 1: degrees as integers or fixed decimals, counter-clockwise, measured from the room's +X axis. Confirm or change.
- **PROPOSED:**
  - the `core/` / `platform/` split, and the master copy stored as versioned JSON with the named writers (ARCHITECTURE);
  - dimension provenance and appliance placements added to the master copy (DATA_MODEL "core").

### From the owner's workflow (2026-10-27)
- **CV-2 More than one colony.** Will each colony have its own Cabinet Vision library (so its own catalog mappings), or will all colonies share one library? And does each have its own prices?
- **SM-1 Measuring after sign-off.** The client signs off on a design drawn from rough dimensions; the site measure may then change sizes. The earlier plan (2026-10-24) said small within-tolerance differences are absorbed without client re-approval or repricing. Does that still hold? If so, what tolerance? Above it, does the client re-sign?
- **PAY-1 "Paid".** Does "paid" mean paid in full, or a deposit? closet-builder had a deposit to commit and the balance before production. Which payment tool?
- **R-1 Photorealistic.** A realistic 3D view the client can turn in the browser, or rendered still images (slower, more realistic), or both? This is the most expensive part of the editor; the answer sets its cost.
- **DL-1 Deadline ticker.** How is the "everything in by" date worked out? From the colony's production lead time (as data) and the promised delivery date? Who sets the delivery date?
- **PO-1 Automatic ordering.** Who places the orders (you or the colony), which suppliers, and how does each take orders (email, portal, API)? Do "materials" mean sheet goods sent to the colony?
- **MSG-1 Channels.** Which email (Gmail?), which texting service, and which meeting tool's transcripts? Do reminders go by text, email or both?
- **IK-1 to IK-7** Kitchen intake questions, in `docs/intake/kitchen.md`.

### From the spec (section 11)
- **S-1** Which Cabinet Vision versions do target shops run, and does ORDX behave the same across them?
- **S-2** How much room placement and elevation detail does ORDX keep on import?
- **S-3** Which read-back source is most reliable: ORDX export, SQL database, or reports? If it's the database or files on the shop's computer, do we need a small helper app there?
- **S-4** Is there a Cabinet Vision or Cyncly partner program with documentation or support? Licensing and terms must be reviewed before Phase 3.
- **S-5** = U-1.
- **S-6** Which design rules block and which only warn, by default?

### Earlier plan features: keep, defer or drop?
- **E-1 Room states.** Mostly answered by OA-5: the push needs sign-off, appliances, measure and payment, tracked as separate gate conditions. Still open: are these tracked per room or per job? Is invoicing tracked here or only in accounting?
- ~~E-2 Client approval~~ Answered (OA-5): the client signs off before the push.
- **E-3 Pricing structure.** The earlier plan had price lists per manufacturing partner, chosen by region, plus tax per province. The spec says pricing reads from the catalog. Are regions and partners still part of this?
- ~~E-4 Site measuring~~ Answered (OA-5): the site must be measured before the push.
- **E-5** Answered for the visual intake, appliances, the conversation tally, reminders and ordering (all in). Still open: CRM (or do the reminders replace it?) and accounting triggers. Live pricing probably replaces the separate quick quote; confirm.
- **E-6 Locking unit:** job or room?

### Carried over from closet-builder
- **C-1 Reuse.** closet-builder already has pieces that match parts of this spec:
  - room geometry, including "floating walls" for islands and peninsulas (its A-21);
  - a 3D view and a wall elevation view;
  - integer-unit handling;
  - a cabinetry knowledge base (`docs/cabinetry-intelligence/`) that already separates hard design limits from preferences. That is close to the spec's block-vs-warn design rules, and could seed Shop Settings.

  Should any of these be ported (Phase 4–6), or should this project start clean?
- **C-2 Look and feel.** closet-builder has an owner-approved design system (Geist and Newsreader fonts, its own tokens, 2026-10-07/08). `docs/ux/UX_BRIEF.md` has a different palette. Which one applies here?
- **C-3** closet-builder decisions (its `docs/architecture.md` Part 1, 2026-10-08 to 10-10) that differ from this plan. Each needs a yes or no here:
  - **Price list:** one price list, priced per inch by cabinet type, plus % adjustments and flat add-ons (A-1, A-7). Compare E-3.
  - ~~Shops~~ Answered (OA-1): a Hutterite colony. Is it the same Biesse shop closet-builder was written for?
  - **Freezing:** frozen at full payment, except changes that don't touch the design; truly frozen once files are sent to the shop (A-8, A-9, A-11). The spec freezes at "sent".
  - **Payments:** a deposit to commit and the balance before production, through a third-party payment tool (A-8). Compare PAY-1.
  - **Customer change approval:** text and email with a tap to approve, daily reminders, and a decline notifies the designer (A-10). This fits OA-8's reminders and SM-1.
  - **Batches:** a customer can have several batches over the years, each priced as its own project (A-4). Is a job a batch?
  - **Prospects:** customers can sign up themselves and do their own intake (A-3, A-15, A-16).

### Still open from earlier
- CRM choice; QuickBooks vs Xero.
- What clients see, if a client portal is built.
- Tech stack confirmation (ARCHITECTURE "Stack").
- The Comparer's strict tolerance: the values, and whether they are per dimension or per item.
